In 1916 Fred Wehrenberg took over the theater operations and it became known as the \"New Cherokee Theater\". The New Cherokee Theater closed at the end of 1930 and the building was converted to commercial use. The following year the Wehrenberg's Southside Amusement Company opened the Cherokee Bowling and Billiards on the second floor, which later became Cherokee Q M Bowling Alleys and finally the Cherokee Lanes Bowling Alley. Cherokee Lanes closed around 1962 and the Southside Amusement Company sold the building in 1968.\n\nThe building is perhaps best known as the home of the Proper Shoe Store, which opened in the building in 1940 and closed in 2002. While other department stores, such as J. C. Penny's and Fairchild's, operated for decades on Cherokee Street, Proper Shoe Store is the only one that survived into the 21st century, having been in continuous operation for over sixty years. Also known as \"Milton Mandel's Proper Shoe Store\", the building was also home to Mandel's Style Shop, which sold women's clothing during the 1950s and 1960s.\n\nADDITIONAL NOTES\n\u2022\t*The advertised price reflects a $100 discount for paying the rent on the first of the month\n\u2022\tWhen available, short term leases may be subject to additional fees. \n\u2022\tWe require an application (free) and credit check ($15)\n\u2022\tOne-time leasing fee\n\u2022\tPet deposit is typically 1/2 of the full month's rent", "misc": ["1BR / 1Ba", "available jun 1"], "addr": "Cherokee Street at Iowa Avenue", "coord": {"longitude": "-90.230900", "latitude": "38.594300", "accuracy": "22"}, "url": "https://stlouis.craigslist.org/apa/d/loft-with-open-floor-plan-in/6652027259.html"}, {"price": "$645", "title": "COLLINS TERRACE!

In 1916 Fred Wehrenberg took over the theater operations and it became known as the \"New Cherokee Theater\". The New Cherokee Theater closed at the end of 1930 and the building was converted to commercial use. The following year the Wehrenberg's Southside Amusement Company opened the Cherokee Bowling and Billiards on the second floor, which later became Cherokee Q M Bowling Alleys and finally the Cherokee Lanes Bowling Alley. Cherokee Lanes closed around 1962 and the Southside Amusement Company sold the building in 1968.\n\nThe building is perhaps best known as the home of the Proper Shoe Store, which opened in the building in 1940 and closed in 2002. While other department stores, such as J. C. Penny's and Fairchild's, operated for decades on Cherokee Street, Proper Shoe Store is the only one that survived into the 21st century, having been in continuous operation for over sixty years. Also known as \"Milton Mandel's Proper Shoe Store\", the building was also home to Mandel's Style Shop, which sold women's clothing during the 1950s and 1960s.\n\nADDITIONAL NOTES\n\u2022\t*The advertised price reflects a $100 discount for paying the rent on the first of the month\n\u2022\tWhen available, short term leases may be subject to additional fees. \n\u2022\tWe require an application (free) and credit check ($15)\n\u2022\tOne-time leasing fee\n\u2022\tPet deposit is typically 1/2 of the full month's rent", "misc": ["1BR / 1Ba", "available jun 1"], "addr": "Cherokee Street at Iowa Avenue", "coord": {"longitude": "-90.230900", "latitude": "38.594300", "accuracy": "22"}, "url": "https://stlouis.craigslist.org/apa/d/bright-unique-3rd-floor-loft/6667462915.html"}, {"price": "$585", "title": "Its A Lovely Day at Hillcrest!!!!", "desc": "Convenience is waiting for you at Hillcrest Apartments!\nTucked away in a convenient & affordable neighborhood you will fall in love with your new home.

In 1916 Fred Wehrenberg took over the theater operations and it became known as the \"New Cherokee Theater\". The New Cherokee Theater closed at the end of 1930 and the building was converted to commercial use. The following year the Wehrenberg's Southside Amusement Company opened the Cherokee Bowling and Billiards on the second floor, which later became Cherokee Q M Bowling Alleys and finally the Cherokee Lanes Bowling Alley. Cherokee Lanes closed around 1962 and the Southside Amusement Company sold the building in 1968.\n\nThe building is perhaps best known as the home of the Proper Shoe Store, which opened in the building in 1940 and closed in 2002. While other department stores, such as J. C. Penny's and Fairchild's, operated for decades on Cherokee Street, Proper Shoe Store is the only one that survived into the 21st century, having been in continuous operation for over sixty years. Also known as \"Milton Mandel's Proper Shoe Store\", the building was also home to Mandel's Style Shop, which sold women's clothing during the 1950s and 1960s.\n\nADDITIONAL NOTES\n\u2022\t*The advertised price reflects a $100 discount for paying the rent on the first of the month\n\u2022\tWhen available, short term leases may be subject to additional fees. \n\u2022\tWe require an application (free) and credit check ($15)\n\u2022\tOne-time leasing fee\n\u2022\tPet deposit is typically 1/2 of the full month's rent", "misc": ["1BR / 1Ba", "available jan 1"], "addr": "Cherokee Street at Iowa Avenue", "coord": {"longitude": "-90.230900", "latitude": "38.594300", "accuracy": "22"}, "url": "https://stlouis.craigslist.org/apa/d/spacious-loft-in-the-historic/6667447196.html"}, {"price": "$900", "title": "1 Bedroom for Immediate Move In CWE!!!

In 1916 Fred Wehrenberg took over the theater operations and it became known as the \"New Cherokee Theater\". The New Cherokee Theater closed at the end of 1930 and the building was converted to commercial use. The following year the Wehrenberg's Southside Amusement Company opened the Cherokee Bowling and Billiards on the second floor, which later became Cherokee Q M Bowling Alleys and finally the Cherokee Lanes Bowling Alley. Cherokee Lanes closed around 1962 and the Southside Amusement Company sold the building in 1968.\n\nThe building is perhaps best known as the home of the Proper Shoe Store, which opened in the building in 1940 and closed in 2002. While other department stores, such as J. C. Penny's and Fairchild's, operated for decades on Cherokee Street, Proper Shoe Store is the only one that survived into the 21st century, having been in continuous operation for over sixty years. Also known as \"Milton Mandel's Proper Shoe Store\", the building was also home to Mandel's Style Shop, which sold women's clothing during the 1950s and 1960s.\n\nADDITIONAL NOTES\n\u2022\t*The advertised price reflects a $100 discount for paying the rent on the first of the month\n\u2022\tWhen available, short term leases may be subject to additional fees. \n\u2022\tWe require an application (free) and credit check ($15)\n\u2022\tOne-time leasing fee\n\u2022\tPet deposit is typically 1/2 of the full month's rent", "misc": ["1BR / 1Ba", "available jan 1"], "addr": "Cherokee Street at Iowa Avenue", "coord": {"longitude": "-90.230900", "latitude": "38.594300", "accuracy": "22"}, "url": "https://stlouis.craigslist.org/apa/d/open-floor-plan-loft-perfect/6641387597.html"}, {"price": "$695", "title": "1 Bedroom Apartment Overlooking Cherokee Street", "desc": "This bright 1 bedroom/1 bathroom apartment features hardwood floors, large windows and updated HVAC, electrical and plumbing.

In 1916 Fred Wehrenberg took over the theater operations and it became known as the \"New Cherokee Theater\". The New Cherokee Theater closed at the end of 1930 and the building was converted to commercial use. The following year the Wehrenberg's Southside Amusement Company opened the Cherokee Bowling and Billiards on the second floor, which later became Cherokee Q M Bowling Alleys and finally the Cherokee Lanes Bowling Alley. Cherokee Lanes closed around 1962 and the Southside Amusement Company sold the building in 1968.\n\nThe building is perhaps best known as the home of the Proper Shoe Store, which opened in the building in 1940 and closed in 2002. While other department stores, such as J. C. Penny's and Fairchild's, operated for decades on Cherokee Street, Proper Shoe Store is the only one that survived into the 21st century, having been in continuous operation for over sixty years. Also known as \"Milton Mandel's Proper Shoe Store\", the building was also home to Mandel's Style Shop, which sold women's clothing during the 1950s and 1960s.\n\nADDITIONAL NOTES\n\u2022\t*The advertised price reflects a $100 discount for paying the rent on the first of the month\n\u2022\tWhen available, short term leases may be subject to additional fees. \n\u2022\tWe require an application (free) and credit check ($15)\n\u2022\tOne-time leasing fee\n\u2022\tPet deposit is typically 1/2 of the full month's rent", "misc": ["1BR / 1Ba", "available jan 1"], "addr": "Cherokee Street at Iowa Avenue", "coord": {"longitude": "-90.230900", "latitude": "38.594300", "accuracy": "22"}, "url": "https://stlouis.craigslist.org/apa/d/must-see-loft-on-cherokee/6640279510.html"}, {"price": "$850", "title": "Classic & Stylish 2nd Floor Apartment", "desc": "This large, one-bedroom apartment is located in the historic Hess Hardware building, which was constructed in 1894.

The New Cherokee Theater closed at the end of 1930 and the building was converted to commercial use. The following year the Wehrenberg's Southside Amusement Company opened the Cherokee Bowling and Billiards on the second floor, which later became Cherokee Q M Bowling Alleys and finally the Cherokee Lanes Bowling Alley. Cherokee Lanes closed around 1962 and the Southside Amusement Company sold the building in 1968.\n\nThe building is perhaps best known as the home of the Proper Shoe Store, which opened in the building in 1940 and closed in 2002. While other department stores, such as J. C. Penny's and Fairchild's, operated for decades on Cherokee Street, Proper Shoe Store is the only one that survived into the 21st century, having been in continuous operation for over sixty years. Also known as \"Milton Mandel's Proper Shoe Store\", the building was also home to Mandel's Style Shop, which sold women's clothing during the 1950s and 1960s.\n\nADDITIONAL NOTES\n\u2022\t*The advertised price reflects a $100 discount for paying the rent on the first of the month\n\u2022\tWhen available, short term leases may be subject to additional fees. \n\u2022\tWe require an application (free) and credit check ($15)\n\u2022\tOne-time leasing fee\n\u2022\tPet deposit is typically 1/2 of the full month's rent", "misc": ["1BR / 1Ba", "available jun 1"], "addr": "Cherokee Street at Iowa Avenue", "coord": {"longitude": "-90.230900", "latitude": "38.594300", "accuracy": "22"}, "url": "https://stlouis.craigslist.org/apa/d/fresh-bright-loft-with-tall/6640579357.html"}, {"price": "$895", "title": "Large Loft with Open Floor Plan on Cherokee Street", "desc": "This is a unique and spacious loft apartment on Cherokee Street with beautiful hardwood floors and tons of light.

You will be just a short walk away from coffee shops, art galleries, markets, parks, and excellent food.\n \nSIZE\n\u2022\tLoft/1 bath\n\u2022\tOwner may be willing to partition off an area for privacy\n \nPRICE\n\u2022\t$895/month* + $50/water, sewer and trash\n \nFEATURES\n\u2022\tAir conditioning/Central heat\n\u2022\tRefrigerator\n\u2022\tStove/oven\n\u2022\tGranite counter tops\n\u2022\tAmple cabinet space\n\u2022\tShared Washer and dryer in building\n\u2022\tAll Electric\n\u2022\tThird Floor Unit\n\u2022\tNewly Painted\n\u2022\tNear Jefferson Avenue, Grand Avenue, and Highway 55\n \nThe apartment is located in the historic Cherokee Theater, which was built in 1911 by the Vaudeville Theater Company. In 1916 Fred Wehrenberg took over the theater operations and it became known as the \"New Cherokee Theater\". The New Cherokee Theater closed at the end of 1930 and the building was converted to commercial use. The following year the Wehrenberg's Southside Amusement Company opened the Cherokee Bowling and Billiards on the second floor, which later became Cherokee Q M Bowling Alleys and finally the Cherokee Lanes Bowling Alley. Cherokee Lanes closed around 1962 and the Southside Amusement Company sold the building in 1968.\n\nThe building is perhaps best known as the home of the Proper Shoe Store, which opened in the building in 1940 and closed in 2002. While other department stores, such as J. C. Penny's and Fairchild's, operated for decades on Cherokee Street, Proper Shoe Store is the only one that survived into the 21st century, having been in continuous operation for over sixty years. Also known as \"Milton Mandel's Proper Shoe Store\", the building was also home to Mandel's Style Shop, which sold women's clothing during the 1950s and 1960s.\n\nADDITIONAL NOTES\n\u2022\t*The advertised price reflects a $100 discount for paying the rent on the first of the month\n\u2022\tWhen available, short term leases may be subject to additional fees. \n\u2022\tWe require an application (free) and credit check ($15)\n\u2022\tOne-time leasing fee\n\u2022\tPet deposit is typically 1/2 of the full month's rent\n\nPlease visit our website for additional listings: www.wjlcompanies.com", "misc": ["1BR / 1Ba", "available jun 1"], "addr": "Cherokee Street at Iowa Avenue", "coord": {"longitude": "-90.230900", "latitude": "38.594300", "accuracy": "22"}, "url": "https://stlouis.craigslist.org/apa/d/large-loft-with-open-floor/6640577892.html"}, {"price": "$1045", "title": "SPACIOUS 3 BEDROOM 3 BATH CONDO W/BASEMENT AND COVERED PARKING", "desc": "Move in this week!\n\nLarge 3 Level 3 Bedroom 3 Bath Condo.\n\nSpacious and roomy\n\nHuge master bedroom with Master Bath.\n\nFlorissant school district.\n\nI pay all utilities except water and electric.\n\nOne or two year lease available.Requirements: One year at current employment, $3000 minimum gross income, no evictions, unpaid utilities or bankruptcies in last 3 years.\n\nI own and manage over 110 condos and houses in North County.

In 1916 Fred Wehrenberg took over the theater operations and it became known as the \"New Cherokee Theater\". The New Cherokee Theater closed at the end of 1930 and the building was converted to commercial use. The following year the Wehrenberg's Southside Amusement Company opened the Cherokee Bowling and Billiards on the second floor, which later became Cherokee Q M Bowling Alleys and finally the Cherokee Lanes Bowling Alley. Cherokee Lanes closed around 1962 and the Southside Amusement Company sold the building in 1968.\n\nThe building is perhaps best known as the home of the Proper Shoe Store, which opened in the building in 1940 and closed in 2002. While other department stores, such as J. C. Penny's and Fairchild's, operated for decades on Cherokee Street, Proper Shoe Store is the only one that survived into the 21st century, having been in continuous operation for over sixty years. Also known as \"Milton Mandel's Proper Shoe Store\", the building was also home to Mandel's Style Shop, which sold women's clothing during the 1950s and 1960s.\n\nADDITIONAL NOTES\n\u2022\t*The advertised price reflects a $100 discount for paying the rent on the first of the month\n\u2022\tWhen available, short term leases may be subject to additional fees. \n\u2022\tWe require an application (free) and credit check ($15)\n\u2022\tOne-time leasing fee\n\u2022\tPet deposit is typically 1/2 of the full month's rent", "misc": ["1BR / 1Ba", "available jun 1"], "addr": "Cherokee Street at Iowa Avenue", "coord": {"longitude": "-90.230900", "latitude": "38.594300", "accuracy": "22"}, "url": "https://stlouis.craigslist.org/apa/d/spacious-loft-with-lots-of/6640271477.html"}, {"price": "$1145", "title": "Sign a lease and you could win a cruise for two!", "desc": "As a student housing property, you will be renting by the room vs renting the entire apartment.\n\nIcon Student Spaces is redefining the student living experience by offering a high class lifestyle of apartment living conducive to the student lifestyle in St. Louis, Missouri.
